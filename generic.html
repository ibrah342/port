							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/F.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I am a first-generation college student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota. Growing up in a challenging environment, I have faced numerous obstacles, including the loss of my father, my stepfather's stroke, and my older brother's struggles with addiction. Despite these hardships, I have remained dedicated to my education and passion for technology.

								My journey in Computer Science includes creating projects like a 2D Array Chess Game and a Fractal Drawing program, which showcase my creativity and problem-solving skills. I have also taken on leadership roles, co-founding the Somali in Business and Tech (SIBAT) organization and the Colorstack UMN chapter, to support underrepresented students in tech.
								
								Volunteering as a tutor at Best Buy Teen Tech, I have designed curricula and taught Python to high school students, enhancing my communication and leadership skills. My professional experience includes positions as an Operations Engineer intern at Ameriprise Financial and a Software Engineer intern at SPS Commerce, where I have applied my technical knowledge in real-world settings.
								
								Balancing my academic responsibilities with family needs has been challenging, but it has also fueled my determination to succeed. I am committed to leveraging my experiences to make a positive impact on my community and inspire others through my journey.
								
								For any inquiries or opportunities, feel free to reach out to me. I am always open to discussing new projects, creative ideas, or potential roles. Looking forward to connecting with you!</p>
